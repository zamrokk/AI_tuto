## Choice 

| Method | Advantages | Disadvantages | Use cases |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Fine-Tuning | High precision on a domain | Expensive, requires data | Classification, translation |
| RAG | Easy updates, transparency | Latency, dependence on sources | Chatbots, Q&A systems |
| Prompt Engineering | Fast and low-cost | Less precise than fine-tuning | Prototypes, small teams |
| Distillation | Lightweight model | Potential performance loss | Mobile, edge computing |
